Collaboration
- Nope. Did no collaborate with anyone. Shared some ideas of my implementation to those who asked. Help explain some of the flow of the sample code to those who asked.

References
- Stackoverflow and OpenGL documentation was really helpful! :D

Known problem with the code
- Extra credit: Fading colour. There is a jump somewhere between from pink to red. Although the stepping to the next is implemented correctly because all the other colours worked, but just this transition have a awkward jump. Probably because of how the 3 values to indicate the colour is implemented?

Extra Credits
1. Spin Model
	- Just hit 'r', the model will start spinning.
	- hit 'r' multiple times, the model will spin faster each time 'r' is hit.
2. Smooth Transition between differen colours.
	- just hit 'c', the colour will slowly change to the next colour.
	- While the colour is changing. Hitting 'c' does not trigger colour change.
	- 'c' can only be pressed again after the colour changing is done. 
3. Mouse based camera control.
	- click and drag left and right to turn camera. 
	- click and drag up and down to zoom in and out.

Comments:
Tried figuring how to compile the code on the computer in digital systems lab, but somehow even the starter code does not work. Keeps saying freeglut.dll is missing, but it is right in the same directory. 
No access to Digital System lab, had to knock the door until someone helps us to open it. Doesn't make sense if we are asked to make sure our code can be compiled on the computers in Digital System Lab but we can't even access the room.
